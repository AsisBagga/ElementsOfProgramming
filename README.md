# EPI Judge

## Beta 5

## Introduction

EPI Judge is meant to serve as a companion to our book Elements of Programming Interviews. Specifically, this project consists of the following:

- **Stub programs** for each problem in our book in Python
- **Test-cases** that cover common corner-case and performance bugs
- A **framework** for running these tests on your implementation on your machine

## Installation

Here's how to download the judge:

    $ git clone https://github.com/adnanaziz/EPIJudge.git
If you do not have `git`, here's a good [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) on installing git itself.
